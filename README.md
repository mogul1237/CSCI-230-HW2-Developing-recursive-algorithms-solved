Let a be a java array of integers. Develop recursive algorithms to compute the following:
a. The maximum element of the array
b. The minimum element of the array
c. The sum of the elements of the array
d. The product of the elements of the array
e. The average of the elements of the array
Create a java class named ArrayProcessing that includes the coded methods above. Include
a main method to display the contents of a, followed by the results of each of the methods
a-e in the order shown, with appropriate labels. Ex. “The sum of the element in a is ???”
Due: Wednesday, July 22, 4pm. Bring copy of program with output to turn in at the start of
class.
